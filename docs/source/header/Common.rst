Common
======

The ``Common.h`` header contains global definitions used in many places of the
code.  The following compile time constants are defined:

CUBISM_DIMENSION
   The dimension of the default data structures generated by the compiler.  The
   default is ``CUBISM_DIMENSION=3``.

For ``CUBISM_DIMENSION=1,2,3`` the following ``enum`` classes are defined that
can be used for more descriptive code:

Dir
   Specifies direction.  For ``CUBISM_DIMENSION=3`` the values are ``Dir::X``,
   ``Dir::Y`` and ``Dir::Z`` for example.

Vector
   Is an alias for ``Dir``, where the values are interpreted as components
   instead of direction.

Tensor
   Combines direction and component. For ``CUBISM_DIMENSION=2`` the values are
   ``Tensor::XX``, ``Tensor::XY``, ``Tensor::YX`` and ``Tensor::YY``.
